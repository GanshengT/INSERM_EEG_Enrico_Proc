Spectral Analysis and preprocessing of EEG signals
======================
As both sample sizes and EEG channel densities increase, traditional processing approaches like manual data rejection are becoming unsustainable. Different from the classical EEG signals analysis, here we provide a convenient wrapper of [mne](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) functions to do the semi-automatic preprocessing and spectral analysis. The examples and scripts are correspond to this [specific experiment design](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326542100_Differential_effects_of_non-dual_and_focused_attention_meditations_on_the_formation_of_automatic_perceptual_habits_in_expert_practitioners).

## Workflow
The workflow consists of two parts. 
### Preprocessing
Electroenchephalography (EEG) recordings have a high degree of artifact contamination, so the first part is artifact rejection which includes following steps:
* visual inspection: This steps helps to define the bad electrodes and do not take them into conside
ration in the following steps, bad eletrodes will be interpolated after preprocessing.
* filter - 1-100Hz passband filter and 50 Hz notch filter (France) *Notice: this happens after extracting signal in practice but it might have edge effet*
* signal extraction and annotation engineering:</br>
 The raw data is cut from event 254 to event 255, then we recode the events as follows:
    *events code: state + condition + session:
        1. state: 1:VD 2:FA 3:OP\n",
        2. condition: 1:baseline 2:safe 3:threat\n",
        3. session: 1:session1 2:session2\n",
