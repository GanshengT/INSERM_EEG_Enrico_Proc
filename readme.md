Spectral Analysis and preprocessing of EEG signals
======================
As both sample sizes and EEG channel densities increase, traditional processing approaches like manual data rejection are becoming unsustainable. Different from the classical EEG signals analysis, here we provide a convenient wrapper of [mne](https://martinos.org/mne/stable/index.html) functions to do the semi-automatic preprocessing and spectral analysis. The examples and scripts are correspond to this [specific experiment design](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/326542100_Differential_effects_of_non-dual_and_focused_attention_meditations_on_the_formation_of_automatic_perceptual_habits_in_expert_practitioners).

## Prerequest
### Environment
Language we used for programming is python, MNE-Python is the essential tool to preprocess the data and perform sensor-level analysis.  
[How to install mne]  
To perform mathematical easily, we use numpy and scipy

### Database
The database are the EEG recording files using eeglab format. Each file stands for one state, three in total. (Please refer to the experiment design). Additionally, each subject performs two sessions, thus, each subjects has 6 raw-data files. The recording contains 64 EEG channels and 2 EOG channels (VEOG and HEOG)


## Workflow
The workflow consists of two parts. 
### Preprocessing
Electroenchephalography (EEG) recordings have a high degree of artifact contamination, so the first part is artifact rejection which includes following steps:
* visual inspection: This steps helps to define the bad electrodes and do not take them into conside
ration in the following steps, bad eletrodes will be interpolated after preprocessing.
* filter - 1-100Hz passband filter and 50 Hz notch filter (France) *Notice: this happens after extracting signal in practice but it might have edge effet, for practical purpose, we fix sampling rate as 512 for all the recording files*
* signal extraction and annotation engineering:</br>
 The raw data is cut from event 254 to event 255, then we recode the events as follows:  
    * events code: state + condition + session:
        1. state: 1:VD 2:FA 3:OP  
        2. condition: 1:baseline 2:safe 3:threat  
        3. session: 1:session1 2:session2  
    At the end, we concatenate three recording files for one sessions into one epoching file.
* ASR - [artifact subspace reconstruction](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30440615)  
    * selecting baseline signal, use yule walker to amplify artifact components
    * cut blinks based on VEOG channel
